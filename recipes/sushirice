        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. It's cooked<br>
            short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, cooled<br>
            with a specific kind of duck and takes days to prepare, but this version comes together<br>
        </p>
        <p>The best rice for sushi is short-grain Japanese rice â€” this is what's in the bags<br>
            labeled "sushi rice" at the store.<br>
            This glutinous rice has a higher starch content than other varieties, which gives<br>
            it the sticky texture you're after when you make sushi.<br>
        </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)
            3 cups water
            1/2 cup rice vinegar
            1 tablespoon vegetable oil
            1/4 cup white sugar
            1 teaspoon salt
        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            Rinse the rice in a strainer nder cold running water until the water runs clear.
            Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.
            Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. 
            Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat.
            Stir into the cooked rice. Keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools.
        </ol>
